# Linear Algebra

Is the branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and matrices, their linear combinations, transformations, and systems of equations.
It is also used in the field of [[Computer Engineering]] represent data in a computer.

It is a very important branch of mathematics because it is used in many fields of science and engineering. Such as:
- [[geometry]]
- [[calculus]]
- [[statistics]]
- [[data science]]
- [[differential equations]]

It provides a compact form for expressing and manipulating data.

## Vectors

A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. It is represented by a line with an arrow at the end. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector and the length of the line indicates the magnitude of the vector.

## Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. It is represented by a table with rows and columns. The numbers in the table are called the elements of the matrix.

## Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form:

$$ax + by = c$$

Where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are real numbers and $x$ and $y$ are variables.

## Linear Systems

A linear system is a set of linear equations. For example:

$$2x + 3y = 5$$

$$x + 2y = 3$$

## Linear Combinations

A linear combination of vectors is a sum of vectors multiplied by real numbers. For example:

$$2\vec{a} + 3\vec{b}$$

## Linear Transformations

A linear transformation is a function that takes a vector and returns a vector. For example:

$$T(\vec{a}) = 2\vec{a}$$

## Linear Independence

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. For example:

$$\vec{a} = 2\vec{b} + 3\vec{c}$$

## Linear Dependence

A set of vectors is linearly dependent if at least one vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. For example:

$$\vec{a} = 2\vec{b} + 3\vec{c}$$

## Linear Subspaces

A linear subspace is a set of vectors that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. For example:

$$\vec{a} = 2\vec{b} + 3\vec{c}$$

## Linear Span

The linear span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in the set. For example:

$$\vec{a} = 2\vec{b} + 3\vec{c}$$

## Linear Basis

A linear basis is a set of vectors that is linearly independent and that spans the vector space. For example:

$$\vec{a} = 2\vec{b} + 3\vec{c}$$
